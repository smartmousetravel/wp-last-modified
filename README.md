# Setting the HTTP Last-Modified header field in WordPress

This is a trivial WordPress plugin that sets the Last-Modified response
header field ([RFC 2616
§14.29](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.29)) for single
posts to the post’s modification date. There are many like it, but this
one is mine.
